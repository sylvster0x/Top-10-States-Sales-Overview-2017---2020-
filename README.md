# Top-10-States-Sales-Overview-2017---2020-
This dashboard provides a comprehensive sales analysis for 2017–2020, showing how revenue changes over time and the role that individual states, products, customers, and employees play in it—prepared after a break to refresh my Power BI and DAX knowledge.


Top 10 Sattes Sales Overview (2017–2020)

This project is a training Power BI dashboard created to refresh and strengthen my skills in data modeling, DAX, and analytical reporting after a longer break from the tool.
The dashboard analyzes sales performance from 2017 to 2020, focusing on several key areas:

Revenue by state

Performance of top and bottom products

Behavior of key customer segments

Comparison of employee performance

Time-based trends such as MoM, YoY and running totals

The goal of the report is to understand what drives revenue, how it evolves across the four years, and what patterns can be observed across regions, customers, products, and internal operations.

Key Questions Explored
1. Which states generated the highest revenue across the four years?

Analysis of geographic performance highlighting top-performing states and consistent growth trends.

2. How has revenue changed month-over-month and year-over-year?

Evaluation of overall business momentum using MoM% and YoY% indicators, supported by cumulative totals.

3. Which products performed best, and which underperformed?

Comparison of top-selling products versus the bottom segment to identify strong contributors and weak points in the product portfolio.

4. How do customer segments behave over time?

Heatmap analysis showing loyal, high-value customers versus occasional or inconsistent buyers.

5. How does employee performance differ in revenue, margin, and order volume?

Breakdown of team performance to understand efficiency and contribution across employees.
